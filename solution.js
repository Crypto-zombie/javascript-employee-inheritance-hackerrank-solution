To implement prototypal inheritance in JavaScript, you can use the Object.create() method to create a new object that inherits from another object. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve this:

<code>
'use strict';

function Employee(title) {
  this.title = title;
}

Employee.prototype.setTitle = function(newTitle) {
  this.title = newTitle;
};

Employee.prototype.getTitle = function() {
  return this.title;
};

function Engineer(title, isManager) {
  Employee.call(this, title);
  this.isManager = isManager;
}

Engineer.prototype = Object.create(Employee.prototype);

Engineer.prototype.setIsManager = function(newIsManager) {
  this.isManager = newIsManager;
};

Engineer.prototype.getIsManager= function() {
  return this.isManager;
};

</code>

In the modified code:
The Employee constructor takes a single parameter (title) and assigns it to the member variable title.
Two functions are added to the Employee prototype: setTitle, which sets a new value for title, and getTitle, which returns the current value of title.
The Engineer constructor inherits from its parent class (Employee). It takes two parameters (title and isManager) and assigns them to both parent's member variable (this.title) and its own member variable (this.isManager).
